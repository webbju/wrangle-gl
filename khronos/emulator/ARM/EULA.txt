ARM does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury arising from ARM's negligence and because some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages the above limitation relating to liability for consequential damages may not apply to you.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LICENCE, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF ARM TO YOU IN AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS MADE AGAINST ARM IN CONTRACT TORT OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LICENCE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE TOTAL OF SUMS PAID BY YOU TO ARM (IF ANY) FOR THIS LICENCE AND US$5.00.

Upon termination of this Licence by you or by ARM you shall stop using the Deliverables and destroy all copies of the Deliverables in your possession together with all documentation and related materials.

The provisions of Clauses 1,2.3 - 2.6, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 shall survive termination of this Licence.

Except where ARM agrees otherwise in a written contract signed by you and ARM, this is the only agreement between you and ARM relating to the Deliverables and it may only be modified by written agreement between you and ARM. Except as expressly agreed in writing, this Licence may not be modified by purchase orders, advertising or other representation by any person. If any clause in this Licence is held by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Licence shall not be affected thereby. The failure by ARM to enforce any of the provisions of this Licence, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of ARM's rights to enforce such provision or any other provision of this Licence in the future.

You agree to comply fully with all laws and regulations of the United States and other countries ("Export Laws") to assure that the Deliverables are not (1) exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of Export Laws, either to any countries that are subject to U.S.A. export restrictions or to any end user who has been prohibited from participating in the U.S.A. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S.A. government; or (2) intended to be used for any purpose prohibited by Export Laws, including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.
